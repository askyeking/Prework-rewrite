## Pre Work

### Welcome to Skill Distillery

You have started on a path to becoming a professional Software Engineer. What lies ahead is entirely dependent on your commitment, hard work, and curiosity.

Our 16 week bootcamp is divided into three broad sections.

1. Java fundamentals and introduction to programming

2. Java web application development with libraries and frameworks

3. JavaScript and front end frameworks

Each of these sections builds upon the previous and includes a tremendous amount of concepts, syntax and practical application.

We don't expect you to be a developer when you arrive, however, being prepared with the information included in this pre work will help you immensely in the first weeks. The first time you see something, it will be alien and confusing. Each additional time you are exposed it, it will become more familiar and less scary. The underlying concept of this pre work is to give you your first exposure, and to establish a base line understanding from which you can expand.

It is paramount that you complete all of this assigned pre work, and try to the best of your ability to understand concepts you are exposed to. The more effort you apply, and attention you pay the better you will do once onsite.

During the pre work, if you find yourself stuck, or helplessly confused, reach out to your fellow classmates using the Slack channel that you will set up in Part 0 of the pre work. Don’t suffer silently, don’t give up, help one another and succeed.

### Overview

The work outlined in this document will help get you prepared for your first day at Skill Distillery. Completing it prior to your arrival onsite is both mandatory, and essential to your ability to hit the ground running and not lag behind.  Past students who have not completed the pre-work have always struggled and found themselves at greater risk of being unable to complete the program.

The pre work is designed to give you some exposure to programming as well as begin developing your critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

If you just got your Mac and are making the move from Windows or Linux, it might be useful to start familiarizing yourself with some keyboard shortcuts: http://www.danrodney.com/mac/ and http://www.imore.com/top-10-keyboard-shortcuts-new-mac-users-need-know

Our pre work is divided into 4 sections:
1. Setup
2. Skills Assessment
3. Coding
4. Blogging (optional)

These sections are intended to give you a base level of knowledge that we expect all attendees to show up with.

## Start Blogging

### Overview

What follows are a number of possible subject on which you can blog.

You can also use your blog as a journal (if you wish) that charts your progression and understanding from your starting point (now) through the end of the program. It is YOUR blog, and as such you can make it as detailed and thorough as you choose.

### Suggested Topics

* What is the difference between ‘switch’ and ‘if/else’? When would you use one versus the other?

* When would you use ‘=’ vs ‘==’ vs ‘.equals’? Explain what each of these does and in which cases you should use them.

* To generate a random number you use ‘Math.random()’. What is ‘Math’? What is the return type of the ‘.random()’ method. Why is the ‘M’ in ‘Math’ capitalized (you may need to investigate Static classes...hint hint).

* What does it mean to ‘cast a double to an int’? Give an example of when you would do this and explain what is happening.

* What is the difference between ‘while’ and ‘do while’ loops? Give an example of when you would use one versus another. What is the benefit of a ‘do while’ over a ‘while’?

* What happens when you include ‘import java.util.Scanner;’ in your code? Where does this functionality come from? What is the ‘java’ in ‘java.util.Scanner;’?

* What is ‘void’ in a method declaration? How does this differ from declaring a method with a return type?

* When it comes to methods, what is the difference between a “parameter” and an “argument”? Is there one? When would you use one versus the other?

* What experience do you have coding? What have you created already? What do you want to create during/after the program?

* What is your ultimate goal in attending Skill Distillery? How are you going to achieve it? What is your big 'why'?

* What pitfalls have you encountered when trying to learn new skills or accomplish your goals in the past? How are you going to avoid them this time? How are you keeping yourself accountable (who is keeping you accountable)?

* When you get frustrated and discouraged what do you do? How can you keep your confidence up and encourage yourself during the program?

## Blogging 101

### Overview

The development community loves a blog post. As a member you will soon realize that there are an endless number of blogs and blog posts on seemingly every software development topic under the sun.

Blogs are an excellent way to showcase what you know, tricky problems you've overcome, and show potential employers how far you've progressed.

This process will give you some experience with HTML/CSS, some more practice with Git, and give you a chance to reflect on what you did for you pre work and elaborate on your understanding of it.

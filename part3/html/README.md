## Introduction to HyperText Markup Language (HTML)

### Overview

HTML was developed by Tim Berners-Lee in the pre-world wide web days of the 1990s. Berners-Lee was working with CERN and believed that his fellow scientists would benefit from a way to share research with one another over the internet, and so HTML was born. HTML is a language simple enough to be used by anyone, but also dynamic enough to have survived for over 20 years.

During the program, after you've finished learning core Java you will jump head first into developing Web Applications. As you've no doubt experienced, a critical component of any web app is it's _user interface_, the pages you click on, the design of those pages, and their ease of use. On the web, the entire _user interface_ is built with on top of HTML. This guide will help acquaint you with basic HTML and help understand it's core concepts.

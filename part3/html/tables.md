## HTML Tables

### `<table>` & `<tr>` & `<td>`

* An HTML is created using the `<table></table>` element.

* A table consists of some number of rows, an HTML table row is made using the `<tr></tr>` element.

* A table row has some number of table data cells `<td>Some value</td>`, these contain information that you want to display in a tabular format.

* If you wanted to create a 2x2 table, you would have 2 rows (`<tr>`) with 2 data cells (`<td>`) each:

```html
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>3</td>
	</tr>
</table>
```

## Part 3 : Technical Blogging & Introduction to HTML / CSS (Optional)

### Overview

Software developers are constantly learning new skills, finding new bugs, and developing solutions to problems. As a member of this community you will use every resource at your disposal to problem-solve. Sites like [StackOverflow.com][stackoverflow] are useful for researching how to fix problems, but when it comes to learning a new approach or a work-around to a problem, you will often find yourself turning to someone's personal blog.

Blogging is a way for developers to document an approach to a problem and share it with the world. This seemingly selfless process also provides a personal benefit to the blogger: nothing reinforces your understanding of a topic like teaching to someone else. This is doubly true in development where you are forced to break down difficult concepts and complex methodologies into understandable components and communicate them to others with less experience than yourself.

This portion of the pre work will have you set up a technical blog so that you can share your experience with others, as well as document your progression for yourself. You may choose to continue to blogging during the program to show employers both your commitment to the community as well as your progression from complete novice to full stack developer.

This process will familiarize you with the most fundamental building blocks of web pages (_HTML / CSS_), as well as give you additional practice using _Git_ for version control and sharing your work on _Github_.

## Touch Typing

### Overview
As a programmer it is imperative that you be able to type with proficiency. When writing code, we need to expand our comfort beyond just the standard character set, and to include a number of 'special characters'.

You success in your career as well as in this program will rely heavily on your ability to type both quickly and accurately. We believe that the most effective typing strategy that will assist you in this pursuit is 'Touch Typing'.

***WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT???***

Over the past several years we have observed multiple determining factors in influencing any one student's success during the program. By far the most consistent, fundamental, and correctable factor is his or her ability to type well.

### Touch Typing

*Touch Typing* is the practice of typing without using your sense of sight to find keys. To do this the typist knows the location of keys on the keyboard (possibly through sense memory). Touch typing is different from 'hunt and peck' typing, in which a typist uses two or more fingers to type after searching for keys with their eyes on the keyboard, in that the typist can focus their attention on what is being typed on the screen (or something entirely different) while still typing accurately.

Typically *Touch Typing* involves placing your fingers on the _home row_ to orient your initial position on the keyboard with the left index finger on `F` and the right index finger on `J`.

* Most keyboards have a physical mark on these two keys that you can feel with your index fingers.

### Assignment

**If you are already a _Touch Typist_**, take a typing test to determine your current speed and accuracy typing code. You should be able to type faster than 35 words per minute with over 90% accuracy as you begin the program.

* Test your typing ability at https://typing.io and selecting one of the 'Java/Guava' lessons. The benefit of Typing.io is that they will have you practice typing with actual code.

**If you are NOT a _Touch Typist_**, it is important to take typing seriously (painters paint, programmers type).

* *Typing Club* provides free resources to learn touch typing (https://www.typingclub.com/sportal/program-3.game), you should begin these lessons immediately and continue them until you begin the program. You should also strive to use touch typing in your day to day life as practice.

* Practice typing in code with your touch typing skills at https://typing.io to see how it improves your accuracy and speed when typing code.

## Part 1 : Terminal, Typing, Learning & Git

### Overview

In this part of your pre-work you will become more familiar with the tools of software development.

First, you will learn about and get some practice with the _Terminal_ application. This runs a program called a _Unix Shell_ which lets you type commands, and navigate through and modify files on your computer in a more hands-on way than you can with the *Finder* application. The ability to use the _Terminal_ efficiently is a critical skill for software developers and we will use it extensively throughout the program.

The second set of tools you'll need to understand are your fingers. Your ability to type quickly and accurately is not only necessary, but foundational to everything else. Software developers type code 5-8 hours per day, their productivity is directly tied to their ability to type. We will have you take an assessment of your typing ability, and strongly encourage you to start practicing immediately if you don't meet our benchmarks.

Third, you will take an assessment of your learning style.  This is not for us but for you: understanding how you most effectively learn will help you plan your study and practice, and can help reduce frustration as you tackle this challenging program.

Finally, we will introduce you to Git & Github. The former is a version control software extremely common in industry that developers use to share and revert updates to their code. The latter is a social media tool that aids developers in collaborating and gives them a platform to showcase their work. You will use these two technologies to share your pre-work code with us, as well as during the program to share you work with potential employers.

Though it will be tempting to write these fundamental tools off as secondary to the Java content to come, don't do that.  In particular, the importance to a developer of proficient touch-typing can't be overstated.

## Learning Style

### Overview

At Skill Distillery we will present you with the information you need in order to learn full stack web development. That said, it is your responsibility to maximize your learning from the resources and materials we provide. We highly recommend that before starting the program you spend some time getting to know your learning style and how to optimize your learning while onsite. At the very least, take the VARK Questionnaire (http://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/) and read the study strategies for your dominant learning type(s).

Both during pre-work and during the program, consider your VARK learning style and supplement your understanding with the materials that will most effectively benefit you. If you are a highly visual learner, maybe YouTube will be a good resource. Reading learners might do better finding blog resources or combing through documentation. While kinesthetic learners will need to practice repeatedly.

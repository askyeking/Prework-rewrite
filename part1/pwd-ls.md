#### `pwd` and `ls` - *Print Working Directory (print where you currently are in file system), list files*

* At all times in the terminal, you have a _current working directory_ - that is, you are always somewhere in the file system.

* Executing the `pwd` command prints the path to your current working directory in there terminal. As I navigate from HOME to `notes` again you'll see the directories change.  

* On Unix, `.` represents the current directory, and `..` represents its parent directory (one level up).

#### `ls`- *List Files (list all files in your current location)*

* `ls` allows you to display the contents (files and folders) inside of your current location or any other directory.

* Lets take a look at the contents of `Home`, `Desktop`, and notes and see how they correspond to what finder shows us.

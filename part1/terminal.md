## Terminal Overview

### Overview

The _Terminal_ is a unix environment that allows you to communicate with your operating system. The _Finder_ tool on MacOS is a GUI that serves the same purpose. Some people are much more familiar using graphical tools like _Finder_ or Windows _File Explorer_, but getting comfortable with a _Terminal_ window can save you lots of time as a developer. It is also a necessity when working with systems that don't have a GUI operating system. We will get experience in an environment like this during the program when using the Amazon cloud EC2 services.

As we start to learn Java in this program we will simultaneously be learning some Unix commands. This walkthrough is meant as a primer for a few commands you will need during the pre work.

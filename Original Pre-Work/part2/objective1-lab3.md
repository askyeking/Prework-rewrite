## Lab 3 - Creating a `class`

### Overview

* Create a file called _Objective1Lab3.java_ in the _~/SDPre/Labs_ directory. This program should print out your name, age, and the state in which you were born in the following format.

```
Name : Peter Williams
Age : 32
State : New York
```

* This time there is no _Starter Code_ provided for you. You are going to create the entire file structure from scratch. **DO NOT COPY AND PASTE**. While the code is similar and it is enticing to use a solution you already have, the additional repetitions will aid in impressing this process in your mind.

* Your class name should match the name of the file: `Objective1Lab3`.

### Expected Input

```bash
>> javac Objective1Lab3.java
>> java Objective1Lab3
```

### Expected Output

```bash
Name : Peter Williams
Age : 32
State : New York
```

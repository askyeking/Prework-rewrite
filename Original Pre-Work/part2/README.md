### Part 2 : Introduction to Java

### Overview

This is the second section of your pre work that will involve writing Java code.

You must complete exercises 1-38 in the _Java the Hard Way_ material that we’ve sent you. It is a significant amount of material and completing it will give you a sense of what you are in for during the first part of the program. We ask that you do not use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc. to complete this work and instead use a text editor (Atom) and the terminal. This will give you the experience of typing every line you write out yourself ‘the hard way’, better reinforcing your understanding.

Don't skip the _Introduction_ chapter because it describes how to use the book as a learning tool.  Most importantly, it encourages you to type the code by hand.  While this may sound tedious, it is a proven way to learn and should not be discounted.

You will be presented with several additional exercises, one after each set of _Java the Hard Way_ lessons.

After completing an exercise, use `git` to push your solutions to your _Github_ repository. We will be reviewing your code and will evaluate your comprehension as you enter the program. _This prework coding is a graded part of the overall program_.  You will get additional experience with `git` while completing your work, and your code will be publicly available and easily accessible should you want to refer to it during the program.

If you have time, we encourage you to continue beyond exercise 38.

Once you have completed each of the tasks in this part and feel comfortable with what you are doing we have some optional tasks that you can tackle. [Continue to Part 3 : Technical Blogging](../part3)

### Structure

Each of the following objectives will have a similar structure.

1. First you will read and follow along with exercises from "Java the Hard Way"

2. Next you will complete some drills to get additional practice with the topics covered in the exercises

3. You will use `git` to push your completed work (the "Java the Hard Way" exercises as well as the completed drills) to _Github_ so that we can review it before you start onsite

   * The first task will have you create a repository for this. [Objective0](objective0-README.md) details the setup process.

## Lab 4 - Odd or Even

### Overview
* Create a file called _Objective4Lab4.java_ in the _SDPre/Labs_ directory.
  * Create a class structure with the name _Objective4Lab4_.
  * Create a main method.
  * Create a scanner.
    * Take in a number and store it into  a variable.
  * Determine if the number is even or odd
* **Hint** The modulus operator `%` returns a value based on the remainder after division of one number by another. For example `8 % 4` would return `0`, while `9 % 2` would return 1. What number would need to test for to determine if a number is even or odd?

```java
  int num = 6;

  if(num % 2 == 0){
    //would determine if a number is even
  }
```

* This time there is no `Starter Code` provided for you. You are going to create the entire file structure from scratch. **DO NOT COPY AND PASTE**. While the code is similar and it is enticing to use a solution you already have, the additional repetitions will aid in impressing this process in your mind.

### Expected Input
```bash
>> javac Objective4Lab4.java
>> java Objective4Lab4
```
### Expected Output
```bash
Please enter a number:
43
The number is odd
```

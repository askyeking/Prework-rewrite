## Lab 4 - Sum Numbers

### Overview
* Create a file called _Objective6Lab4.java_ in the _SDPre/Labs_ directory. Write a program that sums up the numbers 1 -> 20 `1 + 2 + 3 ... + 20` using a while loop.
  * Create a class structure with the name `Objective6Lab4`.
  * Create a main method.
  * Create two variables to store the current sum total and a counter.
  * Write a while loop.
    * Use the `count` variable to have the loop execute 20 times.
    * Increment the value of `count`  with each iteration.
    * Update the current `sum` by adding `count` to `sum` with each iteration.

* This time there is no _Starter Code_ provided for you. You are going to create the entire file structure from scratch. **DO NOT COPY AND PASTE**. While the code is similar and it is enticing to use a solution you already have, the additional repetitions will aid in impressing this process in your mind.`

### Expected Input
```bash
>> javac Objective6Lab4.java
>> java Objective6Lab4
```
### Expected Output
```bash
210
```

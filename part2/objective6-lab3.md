## Lab 3 - Identify Odd and Even Numbers

### Overview
* Create a file called _Objective6Lab3.java_ in the _SDPre/Labs_ directory.
* Using the _Starter Code_ below add code to the commented areas that would:
* Print out the number 1 -> 20 stating while also stating if the number is odd or even.
  * Write a while loop.
    * Use the provided `counter` variable to have the loop execute 20 times.
    * Write an if statement that determines if the number is even or odd, think (`%`) operator.
      * Print out `counter` ` is even` or ` is odd` accordingly.
    * Increment the value of `counter`  with each iteration.
  * e.g.
  ```
    1 is odd
    2 is even
    3 is odd
    4 is even
    ...
    20 is even
  ```

### Starter Code
```java
public class Objective6Lab3 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int counter = 1;

    /*
      Your solution goes here
    */
  }
}
```
### Expected Input
```bash
>> javac Objective6Lab3.java
>> java Objective6Lab3
```
### Expected Output
```bash
1 is odd
2 is even
3 is odd
4 is even
5 is odd
6 is even
7 is odd
8 is even
9 is odd
10 is even
11 is odd
12 is even
13 is odd
14 is even
15 is odd
16 is even
17 is odd
18 is even
19 is odd
20 is even
```

## Lab 5 - Find the Sum

### Overview
* Create a file called _Objective3Lab5.java_ in the _SDPre/Labs_ directory.
  * Create a class structure with the name `Objective3Lab5`.
  * Create a main method.
  * Create a scanner.
    * Take in two numbers and store them into variables.
    * **Hint** Use `input.nextDouble()` to have decimal precision.
  * Calculate and print the result of summing these two values.

* This time there is no _Starter Code_ provided for you. You are going to create the entire file structure from scratch. **DO NOT COPY AND PASTE**. While the code is similar and it is enticing to use a solution you already have, the additional repetitions will aid in impressing this process in your mind.

### Expected Input
```bash
>> javac Objective3Lab5.java
>> java Objective3Lab5
```
### Expected Output
```bash
Please enter a number:
12
Please enter another number:
2
The sum of 12.0 + 2.0 = 14.0
```
